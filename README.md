# GeoFinder 
GeoFinder reads all the place names in a GEDCOM genealogy file, validates and corrects them and adds their latitude/longitude.  For unrecognized places, it supports wildcard searches and phonetic searches from the 20M entry geoname.org database.


## Overview  
GeoFinder reads in a GEDCOM geneology file and looks up each place (PLAC entry) in a gazetteer using location data from geonames.org.  It is used to help fix place name errors in large gedcom files.  It also fills in the latitude and longitude for any places that are found.
